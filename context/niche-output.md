# [CTO Name] - Niche Definition & Targeting Strategy

*Generated by CTOx Niche Discovery System*

---

## Final Niche Statement

> [One sentence describing the ultra-specific niche]

**Example:** "I help healthcare SaaS companies in the first 90 days post-acquisition merge their tech stacks using parallel-run migration without feature freeze."

---

## The Three Dimensions

### Industry/Vertical
[Specific vertical - not "tech" or "healthcare" but "healthcare SaaS doing EHR integrations"]

### Situation/Pain
[Specific trigger event - not "scaling" but "first 90 days post-acquisition when two tech stacks must merge"]

### Unique Angle
[Counterintuitive approach - not "best practices" but "parallel-run migration that lets both systems run simultaneously"]

---

|---------|----------------|----------------|

## Sample Outreach Message

*"The message is a redescription of the targeting."*

> **Subject:** [Pattern-break subject line]
>
> [Name],
>
> [Observation about THEIR situation - specific to targeting]
>
> [Implication - why this matters to their business]
>
> [Quantified value - specific $ or time impact]
>
> [Gift/Value - something useful with no ask]
>
> [Soft invitation - not "Can we meet?" but "Reply if you want the full breakdown"]

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Run targeting columns in Exa to get initial list
2. [ ] Validate 10 companies manually (do they actually match?)
3. [ ] Refine queries based on false positives
4. [ ] Build outreach sequence around validated message
5. [ ] Test with 25-50 contacts before scaling
