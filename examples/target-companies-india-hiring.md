## Tier 1: Actively Expanding - Verified Decision Makers

### 1. Tekion
**Situation:** SaaS unicorn (automotive) massively expanding India, adding 300+ AI/engineering roles
**Decision Maker:** Binu Mathew, CTO
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/binupmathew/
**Signal:** Just took 240,000 sq ft in Bangalore (2,300 employee capacity)
**Pain Point:** Rapid scaling in a cutthroat Bangalore market

**Outreach:**
> Saw Tekion's 240K sq ft expansion in Bangalore - that's 2,300 seats to fill. I spent 11 years building and rebuilding engineering teams in Bangalore at [Previous Company], including recovering from a 160-person exodus in under 6 months. The Bangalore market has specific traps - the 60-90 day notice period counter-offer window, the "yes but ghost" problem, and salary wars that can 3x your offers. Happy to share what I learned the hard way if useful.

### 2. UKG (Ultimate Kronos Group)
**Situation:** Largest US private SaaS company, hiring 500+ in Pune, expanding by 1/3 across India
**Decision Maker:** Nitin Chandel, Group Vice President & India Country Manager
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-chandel-6b175a1/
**Signal:** Just opened Pune Centre of Excellence, already 3,000+ in India
**Pain Point:** Rapid scale across multiple India cities simultaneously

**Outreach:**
> Congrats on the Pune COE launch - scaling from 3,000 to 4,000+ across Noida, Mumbai, Bangalore, and now Pune is a serious coordination challenge. I've done this at [Previous Company] - rebuilt multiple India teams in parallel after significant attrition. The key was using a "borrowed manager" strategy to build 3 teams simultaneously instead of serially. Would be happy to share the playbook if helpful as you scale.

---

### 3. Guidewire
**Situation:** Doubling India headcount to 1,000 by 2028, new 81,664 sq ft Bangalore GCC
**Decision Maker:** Mohammed Anzy S, VP Engineering & Managing Director India
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/anzy/
**Signal:** Just opened new Bangalore office (Sept 2025), 600 seats
**Pain Point:** Scaling professional services AND engineering simultaneously

**Outreach:**
> Saw Guidewire's new Bangalore GCC launch and the plan to hit 1,000 by 2028. That's ambitious - doubling in 3 years in the most competitive talent market in India. I've been through the Bangalore scaling wars at [Previous Company], including rebuilding after losing 25+ engineers in one team. The retention structures that worked weren't reactive counter-offers - they were proactive (retention bonuses baked into contracts from day 1). Happy to share what moved the needle if useful.

---

### 4. Samsara
**Situation:** New Bangalore R&D hub (Feb 2024), building foundational platform team
**Decision Maker:** Sharath Udupa, VP Engineering & India Site Lead
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharathudupa/
**Signal:** Recently incorporated Bangalore entity, actively scaling
**Pain Point:** New India presence = vulnerable to all the common mistakes

**Outreach:**
> Saw Samsara's Bangalore R&D hub is now 18 months in. The first 2 years are where most US companies make the mistakes that cost them later - wrong retention structures, no counter-offer defense, and underestimating the notice period game. I spent 11 years learning Bangalore hiring the hard way at [Previous Company]. If you're hitting any friction on retention or offer acceptance rates, I've seen the patterns and know what works.

---

### 5. Atlassian
**Situation:** Building fully-staffed R&D center in India, strong Bangalore presence
**Decision Maker:** Raja Vobugari, Head of Engineering
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/raja-vobugari/
**Signal:** 20+ years in Bangalore, scaling India engineering org
**Pain Point:** Maintaining culture while scaling in competitive market

**Outreach:**
> Saw you've been building Atlassian's Bangalore presence - 20 years in the city means you've seen the talent market evolve. Curious if you're seeing the same patterns I saw at [Previous Company]: the 60-90 day notice period as a counter-offer window, the monthly check-in cadence needed to prevent ghosting, and the salary escalation that can 3x your offers. If any of those resonate, happy to share what tactics actually moved the needle.

---

## Tier 2: Recently Restructured - Rebuild Opportunities

### 6. Oracle India
**Situation:** Laid off ~10% of India workforce (2,800+ people from 28K+)
**Decision Maker:** [Requires LinkedIn research - Oracle India Engineering VP]
**Signal:** Major restructuring announced 2025
**Pain Point:** Need to rebuild specific functions while managing morale

**Outreach:**
> The Oracle India restructuring was significant - 10% across 28K+ people creates gaps that need to be filled strategically, not just replaced headcount-for-headcount. I've been through this exact situation at [Previous Company] - we lost 160 people across India in 1-2 months. The rebuild approach matters: which roles to rehire first (based on dependency mapping), how to stabilize the people who stayed, and how to structure offers so you don't lose them to counter-offers 60 days later. If you're in rebuild mode, happy to share the playbook.

---

### 7. Freshworks
**Situation:** Multiple rounds of layoffs (2022-2023), rebuilding
**Decision Maker:** [Requires LinkedIn research - check leadership page]
**Signal:** CTO departed, ongoing restructuring
**Pain Point:** Stabilizing after multiple cuts

**Outreach:**
> Freshworks has been through significant transition - multiple restructuring rounds and leadership changes create uncertainty that compounds. I've led teams through similar situations at [Previous Company], including rebuilding after losing senior leadership. The counter-intuitive move that worked: focusing on knowledge extraction from departing experts before focusing on new hiring. The institutional knowledge loss is often bigger than the headcount loss. If you're navigating this, happy to share what worked.

---

## Tier 3: Growing India Presence

### 8. Confluent
**Situation:** Exceeded India headcount target, grew staff 50%+ in 2024
**Decision Maker:** [Requires LinkedIn research - India Site Lead]
**Signal:** Current Bengaluru 2025 conference, major India investment
**Pain Point:** Sustaining 50%+ growth without quality degradation

**Outreach:**
> 50%+ headcount growth in India in one year is impressive - but that's also when the cracks usually start showing. Counter-offer losses spike, new hire quality varies, and the "yes but ghost" problem gets worse. I've scaled and rebuilt Bangalore teams at [Previous Company] multiple times. The tactics that worked were counterintuitive - like reaching back out to people who left (boomerang hiring) and baking 2-year retention bonuses into contracts from day 1. If you're seeing any friction as you scale, happy to share what moved the needle.

---

### 9. Nasuni
**Situation:** Just opened Hyderabad Innovation Center (Sept 2025)
**Decision Maker:** Peddareddappa G (GPR), Senior Director & India Site Leader
**LinkedIn:** [Profile exists but URL not found in search - search "Peddareddappa Nasuni"]
**Signal:** Brand new India presence, partnered with ANSR
**Pain Point:** Building from scratch with no local institutional knowledge

**Outreach:**
> Congrats on the Hyderabad Innovation Center launch. Building from scratch in India is exciting but has specific traps that US companies consistently fall into - wrong retention structures, underestimating the notice period dynamics, and not building counter-offer defenses into your process. I spent 11 years learning India hiring at [Previous Company], including rebuilding teams after significant attrition. Happy to share the lessons if useful as you scale.

---

### 10. ServiceNow India
**Situation:** India is 2nd largest employee base, plans to double
**Decision Maker:** [Requires LinkedIn research - India Site Leadership]
**Signal:** Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai offices
**Pain Point:** Doubling = entering the scaling danger zone

**Outreach:**
> ServiceNow doubling India headcount is ambitious - that's when the Bangalore talent war gets real. Counter-offers spike, offer acceptance rates drop, and the "yes but ghost" problem accelerates. I've been through multiple scaling cycles at [Previous Company], including recovering from losing 25+ engineers in a single team. The tactics that worked were often counterintuitive - like boomerang hiring and building retention bonuses into the initial offer. If you're seeing any of these patterns, happy to share what moved the needle.

---

### 11. Snowflake India
**Situation:** Active Bangalore presence, BUILD Bengaluru conference, scaling to 700+
**Decision Maker:** Vijayant Rai, Managing Director India
**LinkedIn:** [Search "Vijayant Rai Snowflake"]
**Signal:** Developer conference investment in India, new Bangalore office
**Pain Point:** Competing for data engineering talent in hot market

**Outreach:**
> Snowflake's BUILD Bengaluru shows serious India investment. Data engineering talent in Bangalore is among the most competitive - everyone's fighting for the same people. I've navigated Bangalore talent wars at [Previous Company] for 11 years. The counter-offer dynamic in Bangalore is brutal - companies will 3x salary to keep people. The defense has to be built into your process before the offer stage. If you're seeing offer acceptance challenges, happy to share what worked.

---

### 12. Twilio
**Situation:** Hiring VP Engineering for Flex product to establish India presence
**Decision Maker:** [New role - VP Engineering Flex, India Site Lead]
**Signal:** Active job posting for VP Eng/Site Lead in Bangalore
**Pain Point:** Building first India presence for Flex product

**Outreach:**
> Saw Twilio is hiring a VP Engineering to establish Flex's first India presence in Bangalore. That's a critical role - the first 18 months set the culture and operating model for everything that follows. I've built and rebuilt India engineering teams at [Previous Company] over 11 years, including recovering from losing 160 people in 2 months. The playbook for "building from scratch" is different from "scaling" - happy to share the specific traps to avoid if useful.
