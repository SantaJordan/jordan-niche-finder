# Target Companies: India Engineering Team Recovery Expert

**Niche:** US tech companies scaling or rebuilding India/Bangalore engineering teams who need someone who understands the Bangalore talent war, counter-offer dynamics, and parallel team-building strategies.

---

## Tier 1: Actively Expanding (Highest Intent)

### 1. Tekion
**Situation:** SaaS unicorn (automotive) massively expanding India, adding 300+ AI/engineering roles
**Decision Maker:** Binu Mathew, CTO
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/binupmathew/
**Signal:** Just took 240,000 sq ft in Bangalore (2,300 employee capacity)
**Pain Point:** Rapid scaling in a cutthroat Bangalore market

**Outreach:**
> Saw Tekion's 240K sq ft expansion in Bangalore - that's 2,300 seats to fill. I spent 11 years building and rebuilding engineering teams in Bangalore at Riverbed, including recovering from a 160-person exodus in under 6 months. The Bangalore market has specific traps - the 60-90 day notice period counter-offer window, the "yes but ghost" problem, and salary wars that can 3x your offers. Happy to share what I learned the hard way if useful.

### 2. UKG (Ultimate Kronos Group)
**Situation:** Largest US private SaaS company, hiring 500+ in Pune, expanding by 1/3 across India
**Decision Maker:** Nitin Chandel, Group Vice President & India Country Manager
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-chandel-6b175a1/
**Signal:** Just opened Pune Centre of Excellence, already 3,000+ in India
**Pain Point:** Rapid scale across multiple India cities simultaneously

**Outreach:**
> Congrats on the Pune COE launch - scaling from 3,000 to 4,000+ across Noida, Mumbai, Bangalore, and now Pune is a serious coordination challenge. I've done this at Riverbed - rebuilt multiple India teams in parallel after significant attrition. The key was using a "borrowed manager" strategy to build 3 teams simultaneously instead of serially. Would be happy to share the playbook if helpful as you scale.

---

### 3. Guidewire
**Situation:** Doubling India headcount to 1,000 by 2028, new 81,664 sq ft Bangalore GCC
**Decision Maker:** Mohammed Anzy S, VP Engineering & Managing Director India
**LinkedIn:** Search on LinkedIn
**Signal:** Just opened new Bangalore office (Sept 2025), 600 seats
**Pain Point:** Scaling professional services AND engineering simultaneously

**Outreach:**
> Saw Guidewire's new Bangalore GCC launch and the plan to hit 1,000 by 2028. That's ambitious - doubling in 3 years in the most competitive talent market in India. I've been through the Bangalore scaling wars at Riverbed, including rebuilding after losing 25+ engineers in one team. The retention structures that worked weren't reactive counter-offers - they were proactive (retention bonuses baked into contracts from day 1). Happy to share what moved the needle if useful.

---

### 4. Samsara
**Situation:** New Bangalore R&D hub (Feb 2024), building foundational platform team
**Decision Maker:** Sharath Udupa, VP Engineering & India Site Lead
**LinkedIn:** Search on LinkedIn
**Signal:** Recently incorporated Bangalore entity, actively scaling
**Pain Point:** New India presence = vulnerable to all the common mistakes

**Outreach:**
> Saw Samsara's Bangalore R&D hub is now 18 months in. The first 2 years are where most US companies make the mistakes that cost them later - wrong retention structures, no counter-offer defense, and underestimating the notice period game. I spent 11 years learning Bangalore hiring the hard way at Riverbed. If you're hitting any friction on retention or offer acceptance rates, I've seen the patterns and know what works.

---

### 5. Confluent
**Situation:** Exceeded India headcount target, grew staff 50%+ in 2024
**Decision Maker:** Search LinkedIn for India Site Lead / VP Engineering India
**Signal:** Current Bengaluru 2025 conference, major India investment
**Pain Point:** Sustaining 50%+ growth without quality degradation

**Outreach:**
> 50%+ headcount growth in India in one year is impressive - but that's also when the cracks usually start showing. Counter-offer losses spike, new hire quality varies, and the "yes but ghost" problem gets worse. I've scaled and rebuilt Bangalore teams at Riverbed multiple times. The tactics that worked were counterintuitive - like reaching back out to people who left (boomerang hiring) and baking 2-year retention bonuses into contracts from day 1. If you're seeing any friction as you scale, happy to share what moved the needle.

---

## Tier 2: Recently Restructured (Rebuild Opportunity)

### 6. Oracle India
**Situation:** Laid off ~10% of India workforce (2,800+ people)
**Decision Maker:** Search LinkedIn for VP Engineering India / India Country Manager
**Signal:** Major restructuring announced 2025
**Pain Point:** Need to rebuild specific functions while managing morale

**Outreach:**
> The Oracle India restructuring was significant - 10% across 28K+ people creates gaps that need to be filled strategically, not just replaced headcount-for-headcount. I've been through this exact situation at Riverbed - we lost 160 people across India in 1-2 months. The rebuild approach matters: which roles to rehire first (based on dependency mapping), how to stabilize the people who stayed, and how to structure offers so you don't lose them to counter-offers 60 days later. If you're in rebuild mode, happy to share the playbook.

---

### 7. Freshworks
**Situation:** Multiple rounds of layoffs (2022-2023), rebuilding
**Decision Maker:** Leadership team on website
**Signal:** CTO departed, ongoing restructuring
**Pain Point:** Stabilizing after multiple cuts

**Outreach:**
> Freshworks has been through significant transition - multiple restructuring rounds and leadership changes create uncertainty that compounds. I've led teams through similar situations at Riverbed, including rebuilding after losing senior leadership. The counter-intuitive move that worked: focusing on knowledge extraction from departing experts before focusing on new hiring. The institutional knowledge loss is often bigger than the headcount loss. If you're navigating this, happy to share what worked.

---

### 8. TCS
**Situation:** Reduced workforce by 12,000 (2% of global)
**Decision Maker:** India Engineering Leadership
**Signal:** Q2 2026 restructuring
**Pain Point:** Rebuilding mid/senior level talent

**Outreach:**
> The TCS restructuring hit mid and senior-level talent hardest - that's the experience layer that's hardest to replace. I've rebuilt engineering organizations after significant attrition at Riverbed. The key insight: the first hires after a restructuring set the culture for everyone who comes after. Getting those wrong compounds the problem. If you're thinking about how to rebuild strategically vs. just backfilling, happy to compare notes.

---

## Tier 3: Growing India Presence

### 9. Clari
**Situation:** Bangalore engineering team, VP Engineering India
**Decision Maker:** Vishy Ranganath, VP Engineering (appointed 2022)
**LinkedIn:** Search on LinkedIn
**Signal:** Series F funded, scaling globally
**Pain Point:** Maintaining velocity while scaling India team

**Outreach:**
> Clari's India engineering team has been building for a few years now - by this point you've probably learned some of the Bangalore-specific lessons. Curious if you're seeing the same patterns I saw at Riverbed: the 60-90 day notice period as a counter-offer window, the monthly check-in cadence needed to prevent ghosting, and the salary escalation that can 3x your offers. If any of those resonate, happy to share what tactics actually moved the needle.

---

### 10. Enfusion (now Clearwater Analytics)
**Situation:** Acquired by Clearwater, India expansion
**Decision Maker:** India Site Leadership (post-acquisition)
**Signal:** Active hiring in India post-acquisition
**Pain Point:** Integration + expansion simultaneously

**Outreach:**
> Post-acquisition is one of the highest-risk periods for India team retention - uncertainty drives the best people to explore options, and competitors know it. I've navigated similar situations at Riverbed during BU transitions. The tactics that worked: proactive retention structures before people start looking, and reaching out to former employees who might come back now that things have changed. If you're seeing any retention pressure post-acquisition, happy to share what worked.

---

### 11. Nasuni
**Situation:** Just opened Hyderabad Innovation Center (Sept 2025)
**Decision Maker:** Peddareddappa G (GPR), Senior Director & India Site Leader
**LinkedIn:** Search on LinkedIn
**Signal:** Brand new India presence, partnered with ANSR
**Pain Point:** Building from scratch with no local institutional knowledge

**Outreach:**
> Congrats on the Hyderabad Innovation Center launch. Building from scratch in India is exciting but has specific traps that US companies consistently fall into - wrong retention structures, underestimating the notice period dynamics, and not building counter-offer defenses into your process. I spent 11 years learning India hiring at Riverbed, including rebuilding teams after significant attrition. Happy to share the lessons if useful as you scale.

---

### 12. ServiceNow India
**Situation:** India is 2nd largest employee base, plans to double
**Decision Maker:** India Site Leadership (search LinkedIn)
**Signal:** Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai offices
**Pain Point:** Doubling = entering the scaling danger zone

**Outreach:**
> ServiceNow doubling India headcount is ambitious - that's when the Bangalore talent war gets real. Counter-offers spike, offer acceptance rates drop, and the "yes but ghost" problem accelerates. I've been through multiple scaling cycles at Riverbed, including recovering from losing 25+ engineers in a single team. The tactics that worked were often counterintuitive - like boomerang hiring and building retention bonuses into the initial offer. If you're seeing any of these patterns, happy to share what moved the needle.

---

### 13. Snowflake India
**Situation:** Active Bangalore presence, BUILD Bengaluru conference
**Decision Maker:** India Engineering Leadership (search LinkedIn)
**Signal:** Developer conference investment in India
**Pain Point:** Competing for data engineering talent in hot market

**Outreach:**
> Snowflake's BUILD Bengaluru shows serious India investment. Data engineering talent in Bangalore is among the most competitive - everyone's fighting for the same people. I've navigated Bangalore talent wars at Riverbed for 11 years. The counter-offer dynamic in Bangalore is brutal - companies will 3x salary to keep people. The defense has to be built into your process before the offer stage. If you're seeing offer acceptance challenges, happy to share what worked.
