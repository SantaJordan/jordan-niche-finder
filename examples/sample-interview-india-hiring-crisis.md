## Interview Transcript (Condensed)

### Opening Question

**Interviewer:** You gave me two stories - the "Hiring Crisis Firefighter" and the "US-India Bridge Builder." Which one have you actually DONE multiple times?

**CTO:** Story 1 - the crisis recovery.

### Probing for Pattern

**Interviewer:** Have you done this MORE than once? Or is this a single event you're trying to turn into a niche?

**CTO:** 4-5 times. Multiple teams at [Company]. It wasn't just one crisis - we lost 160 people in India in 1-2 months. That's like 25 teams across a 3,000-person enterprise.

### The System Deep-Dive

**Interviewer:** Walk me through what happens when you parachute into a team that just lost 25 people. Not the philosophy - the specific playbook.

**CTO's System:**

**Day 1-7 Assessment:**
- Map team dependencies - what teams do you need, what other teams depend on them
- Identify friction points and data sources
- Review PM team, R&D structure - what exists vs. gaps
- Understand status quo before acting
- Build budget and create hiring structure
- Stay flexible - "chicken and egg" - fit strong candidates as you find them

**Pipeline Building Tactics:**

1. **Borrowed Manager as Force Multiplier**
   - Borrowed a manager from another BU as a proxy
   - Allowed building 3 teams in parallel instead of serially
   - Used resources from other business units strategically

2. **Boomerang Hires**
   - Reached out to people who had left
   - Asked if they wanted to return under new leadership
   - Most leaders are too proud to do this

3. **Vendor-to-FTE Conversion**
   - Tapped existing contractor networks
   - Converted known quantities to full-time

4. **Retention Structure Baked In**
   - Joining bonus AND 2-year retention bonus in contract from day 1
   - Not a reaction to counter-offers - proactive protection

5. **Monthly Check-ins During Notice Period**
   - Someone always touching candidate during 60-90 day danger zone
   - Prevents "yes but ghost" problem
   - Identifies counter-offer risk early

**Knowledge Management:**
- Identified people holding critical product knowledge
- Ran deliberate knowledge extraction strategies
- Transitioned domain experts carefully rather than immediately

## Bangalore-Specific Insights

The CTO identified these India hiring challenges learned the hard way:

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **2-3 Month Notice Periods** | Creates massive counter-offer window |
| **"Yes But Ghost"** | Candidates sign offers but don't show up on day 1 |
| **Counter-Offer Warfare** | Companies will 3x salary to retain departing employees |
| **Interview No-Shows** | Common for candidates to not appear for scheduled interviews |
| **Cultural Dynamics** | Candidates say "yes" to avoid conflict but may not follow through |

**The Bangalore Reality:** "Bangalore is the SF of India - things are cutthroat"

## Emerging Niche Framework

### Industry Dimension
- US enterprise/SaaS tech companies
- With distributed India engineering centers
- Specifically Bangalore-based teams

### Situation Dimension (Episodic Pain)
- Mass attrition crisis (25+ engineers leaving in 1-2 months)
- Triggered by: leadership conflicts, BU dissolution, migration politics, or cultural issues
- Or: Rapid expansion to India without local expertise

### Unique Angle Dimension
- Parallel team-building using borrowed managers as force multipliers
- Boomerang hiring strategy (re-recruiting former employees)
- Vendor-to-FTE conversion pipeline
- Retention bonuses baked into contracts proactively
- Monthly touchpoint system during notice periods
- Knowledge extraction playbook for departing domain experts

## Working Niche Statement (Draft)

> "I help US tech companies who just lost 25+ engineers from their India/Bangalore teams rebuild in under 6 months using parallel team-building, boomerang hiring, and a retention-first contract structure that prevents counter-offer losses."

## Next Steps

1. **Validate the insight** - Is the "borrowed manager as force multiplier" counterintuitive enough?
2. **Quantify the impact** - What's the before/after with numbers?
3. **Build targeting columns** - Find companies in this situation NOW
4. **Craft outreach message** - "The message is a redescription of the targeting"
